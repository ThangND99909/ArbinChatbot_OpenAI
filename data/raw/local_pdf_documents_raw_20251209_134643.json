This test should be completed to verify the performance of the new system before analysing any propriety or non-standard samples.\nThe diagnostic test requires a resistor with bipolar current and power ratings to diagnose the instrument, or a battery to diagnose the system and check specific indicators. Each type of resistance or battery test object \ncan be located in the special diagnostic test program, which is stored in the “qc” directory of the hard disk where the Mits X program files are located (C:\\ArbinSoftware\\qc-xxxx, where “xxxx” is typically the serial \nnumber).\n1. Connect the resistor or resistors.\na. If a resistor with an appropriate load value is available, connect it to a physical channel on the battery tester chassis.\nb. If several such resistors are available, connect them to different chassis, models, and units as needed.\nThe power range of Arbin’s custom-designed test equipment ranges from under one watt up to hundreds of kilowatts. Arbin uses a diverse range of circuits to design these systems, then thoroughly tests them at the \nfactory. The details and results of these testing programs are stored on the Arbin-provided PC and the USB flash drive included with this manual. We have also included a separate document that describes the \nequipment used to perform specific tests on your Arbin battery test equipment.\nYou can run your own performance tests by copying our test conditions. You will then be able to compare the results data with the data generated by Arbin to ensure accurate functionality.\nAlong with testing details and results, the USB flash drive includes a backup of the Mits X software. The flash drive should have the serial number of your particular battery test equipment on it, written on a white label. \nIf you cannot locate the testing program details in either of these two places, please contact Arbin Customer Support.\n1. Set up the program for the diagnostic test.\n2. Locate the file “ab-funsc.sdx” in the “C:\\Arbinsoftware\\qc-xxxx” folder.\n3. Copy the file to the “C:\\Arbinsoftware\\Mits X\\WinDaq\\Work” folder.\n4. Connect the testing device to the system.\n5. To use a suitable device for this test, open the test Schedule and click the “Global” tab.\n6. The section labeled “Information/Comments” describes the devices used to test your equipment at Arbin.\n7. Connect the testing device to each channel of the system to ensure that each board is working properly.\nFigure 2-5 Mits X Login Interface\nFigure 2-6 Registered Icon\nFigure 2-7 Registration Interface\nFor details on creating and editing Schedules, refer to Chapter 6: Schedule Files.\n\n--- Trang 11 ---\n2.3.2 Run the Diagnostic Test\n1. Start the diagnostic test.\na. Select the schedule name in the Mits X console.\nb. Right-click to assign “ab-funsc.sdx+TestObject.to” to the channel connected to the test object. (For more information, refer to the distribution test procedure in 6.2 Manage Schedule Files.)\nc.

(For more information, refer to 10.2 Manage Tests with the Monitor Toolbar.)\n2. Run the diagnostic test.\na. In the startup dialog box, enter the “funsc” as the result file name.\n3. If “UNSAFE is not safe” appears after the second step of “Current Ramp,” please check the battery voltage and the connection with the chassis.\n4. The test result data should be similar to Figure 2-8 below, although different systems will have different values. If the data differs from this graph, please save a copy of the graph and contact Arbin Customer \nSupport.\n \nThe following is a detailed description of the test program template. The pre-defined program “ab-funsc.sdx” is used to check all standard functions of the Arbin battery testing system, including every available mode \nof the hardware and software interface. The channel’s ability to execute this program is a valuable indicator of the system’s normal operation.\n1. Rest for 10 seconds.\n2.

The main directories of these two applications contain the important file “ArbinSys.cfg.” This file is \nrelated to the hardware system configuration and calibration data, which are the basis for test system accuracy.\n3.1.2 Mits X File Organization\nAll test programs and batch files are contained in the C:\\Arbinsoftware\\Console(WinDaq) directory. The following table includes descriptions and locations for Mits X files.\nFigure 2-8 Function Test Current and Voltage Diagram, AB-FUNSC\nIn the rest of the first step of ab-funsc.sdx, the voltage reading on the monitoring and control Interface should be close to the rated voltage of the relevant test battery, or a very small voltage value on the \nresistor. Otherwise, there is a communication problem between the chassis and the computer. In this case, please contact Arbin Customer Support.\nThe maximum current described below is the maximum current of range 1, and the minimum current is the negative value of the maximum current.\nDirectory Name\nLocation\nFile Name\n\n--- Trang 12 ---\nThe system configuration file includes the following:\n1.
